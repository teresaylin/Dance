# Dance!
## MIT 6.831 Group Project
Created by: Alex Chen, Jingyu Li, Teresa Lin, Edward Nguyen

#### Problem
Coordinating and communicating complicated dance routines is a difficult task for choreographers. New ideas for dance moves and formations are hard to remember and edit quickly. Formation changes for an individual dancer are hard to track and visualize. At this time, the available tools on the marketplaces do not properly address these issues. 

#### Dance!
After interviewing users and creating different prototypes, we decided to focus on the problem of helping choreographers track formation changes in time to their choice of music.
